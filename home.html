    <p>The global fashion industry produces <strong>10%</strong> of worldwide pollution, with unsustainable textile practices as a leading cause. In Kenya, the <strong>Gikomba market</strong> is the heart of the second-hand clothing (Mitumba) ecosystem, providing economic opportunity and affordable clothing. However, used and discarded clothing continues to feed landfills like <strong>Dandora</strong>, increasing the environmental burden.</p>
